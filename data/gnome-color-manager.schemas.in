          Gamma is adjusted to affect the color of the attached monitor.
          Traditionally Linux has used a gamma value of 1.0, but this makes monitors look washed out compared Windows XP or OSX.
          Apple traditionally used a value of 1.8 for a long time, but now use the same value as Microsoft.
          Microsoft has always used a value of 2.2.</long>

#: C/gnome-color-manager.xml:469(para)
msgid "The idea of calibration is to put a device is a defined state with regard to its color response. Often this is used as a day to day means of maintaining reproducible behavior.

msgid "Characterization (or profiling) is <emphasis>recording</emphasis> the way a device reproduces or responds to color. Typically the result is stored in a device ICC profile. Such a profile does not in itself modify color in any way. It allows a system such as a CMM (Color Management Module) or a color aware application to modify color when combined with another device profile.

By convention it is stored in a tag called the <type>vcgt</type> tag. Although it is stored in the profile, none of the normal ICC based tools or applications are aware of it, or do anything with it.

Version 2.31.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-08-06

* Important note:
 - This is 2.31.6, which is forked from the gnome-2-30 branch.
 - If you have been using 2.31.5 or any earlier 2.31 version, then you will
   notice the UI and functionality going back in time. This is unfortunate.
 - GNOME 3 has been pushed back 6 months, and the GSettings and GtkApplication
   code is not ready for prime-time just yet. I'm not willing to add multiple
   levels of ifdef'd code for the n-permutations of distros on different GTK
   and GLib versions, so people are just going to make do with 3.30.x with
   a few backported bugs and translation fixes. I do apologise to the
   translators, who have wasted some time on translating git master.
 - This release does not use the new control center panel, GDBus or GSettings,
   nor the new XDG directories location.
 - I don't intend on wasting time backporting features from git master into
   GNOME 2.32.x. Bugfixes will be, where they make sense.
 - In my personal opinion, GNOME 2.32.0 is going to blow goats.

* Bugfix:
 - Use vte_terminal_fork_command_full() as vte_terminal_fork_command() is deprecated (Richard Hughes)
 - Include the trailing colon in translated strings. Fixes #619967 (Richard Hughes)
 - Clean up the temporary file created by cupsGetPPD2(). Fixes rh#582202 (Tim Waugh)

Version 2.30.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-06-01

* Translations
 - Added Japanese translation (Ryo Fujita)
 - Updated British English translation (Bruce Cowan)

* Bugfix:
 - Do not connect to sane in gcm-apply, we only need XRandR devices. Fixes rh#585723 (Richard Hughes)
 - Do not crash when the schema is invalid and GConf reports an error (Richard Hughes)
 - Only connect to SANE and CUPS when the device lists are needed. Fixes rh#590465 (Richard Hughes)
 - Get the profile permissions from GIO rather than hardcoding a hack (Richard Hughes)
 - At login do not attempt to remove previously set X atoms, which speeds up gcm-apply by 750ms (Richard Hughes)

Version 2.30.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-04-26
